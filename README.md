```
     "webpack --config webpack.config.js"
```

If a webpack.config.js is present, the webpack command picks it up by default. We use the --config option here only to show that you can pass a configuration of any name. This will be useful for more complex configurations that need to be split into multiple files.

### Insert CSS in webpack bundle

```
 module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: ["style-loader", "css-loader"],
      },
    ],
  },
```

When multiple loaders are specified in the use property, webpack applies them from right to left. Each loader in the chain performs a specific task or transformation on the source file and passes the result to the next loader.

What is a Bundle?

A bundle is a group of output files generated by the Webpack that contain your app's code & assets, optimized for the browser.
